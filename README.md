# RPG Battle Script
A simple text-based RPG created while learning Python from 'The Complete Python Course: Beginner to Advanced!' by Joseph Delgadillo

Most of the code is and will be similar to [Nick Germaine's](https://github.com/nickgermaine) code as the videos are based off of his 
battle script. I did, however, try and change up somethings such as adding and changing things to fit my vision of the game.

# Discoveries
* While working on this I discovered that HP Bars and MP Bars stay consistent on Mac OS but not on Windows OS

* The game will continue to run after all enemies have been defeated :(.
And since the code is similar in the way it checks if players have been defeated, I am assuming it is the same for players.
